# Bolt GeoJSON parser

This is a small parser to get Bolt scooter/bike data in a nice GeoJSON format for better compatibility.

## Technologies used

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) to run the server-side JavaScript.

[Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) to manage incoming HTTP requests easily.

[Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro/) to send HTTP requests easily.

## Run it yourself

To run this project, you simply need to set up a new Node.js project, get the packages, and modify the "BoltURL" constant in server.js to whichever you prefer. The default is for Brussels.

## You can also do that on Glitch !

[Glitch](https://glitch.com) is a pretty useful and free website which I used to host this project initially. You can access the project and remix it as you which [here](https://glitch.com/~bolt-geojson-parser)
